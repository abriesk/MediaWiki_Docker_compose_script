Ok, so here is result of me playing and testing ChatGPT abilities. This startup.sh script created dir structure, files and all other needed for start of mediawiki on your host.

At first copy startup.sh to any dir where you like to create mediwiki docker. 
Run it with --first-time. 
Ther run it with --start.

Don`t forget to cp ./.env.example to ./.env while adding required info in it.
